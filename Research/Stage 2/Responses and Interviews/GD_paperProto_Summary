Summary of Paper Prototype Results (G.D)
User 1
•	Could locate events in the list
•	Would like to see more information in the list
•	Liked that you could get more information by clicking on an event.
•	Wanted map included straight away in extra info and to be full screen (no tags)
•	Tag buttons too small for finger
•	Commented on cluttered UI. Would prefer it sectioned into 2 separate components
  o	Looking for event
  o	Creating event
•	Liked that map was included to easily find event but would use just prior to attending session (not all possible events plotted)
•	Preferred drop down Create Event
•	Liked that tags were set
•	Major concern – Needs to have separation from Facebook as he has faith in that system and the validity of the users.

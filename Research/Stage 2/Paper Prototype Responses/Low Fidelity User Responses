Find Map and Menu

User 1
•	Map not as apparent, didn’t stick out
    o	Giant space so didn’t notice map on bottom
    o	Can get back to events though
    o	Map coming from top would make more sense because everything is up there
•	Menu - was a little hesitant that the three lines were the menu, but would figure it out eventually, would like a button that just explicitly said “menu”
    o	Use entire space, spread buttons out for chubby fingers
    o	Add button that gets you back to home page, or make it clear what the home page is, is it “events?
    o	User thought maybe you would slide to get back to home page?
User 2
•	Click or drag map button up  arrow insinuates drag
    o	Likes map coming from bottom cause all other selections are on top, keeps it neat
    o	Map should tell what building and room event is in
        ♣	Only filtered events show up on map
        ♣	Drag events to come back down
•	Dos not know where menu is – either 3 lines or logo
    o	Nothing says menu, often menu is the logo, or 3 dots
    o	Would be more clear if menu was a button saying menu or the logo
    o	Menu looks straightforward, clean cut 
        ♣	Could include a help section or FAQs
        ♣	Could also put map in the menu, keep it accessible from different places
    o	Menu button looks more clear as a defined button (on create event pages)

## Introduction
A number of university students aren’t involved with on-campus activities and social events both within their course and UQ in general, possibly due to their lack of motivation or awareness. This disconnect could also stem from a lack of incentive to participate in activity outside of their classes.

Currently, students lack a unified and central platform to set up and organise events on campus. Most students engage with University activity through society email lists, Facebook events or word of mouth. Many of these events remain elusive, either due to Facebook’s strict news feed algorithm or just a contemporary lack of email usage. Ultimately, this leaves many students unaware of or deterred by events because of the inconvenient process.

Our project, titled ‘UQ Lyfe’, is a mobile application that gamifies UQ classes and extracurricular experiences, as a way to incentivise students who wouldn’t normally be involved.

## Concept
The project the team has chosen to develop is driven by a need to increase student involvement in extracurricular activities and also strengthen the sense of community and lifestyle present at the University of Queensland. Additionally, as the campus community can often feel enormous and disconnected, students can lack incentivisation to participate in social events. This product has been labeled UQ Lyfe.

UQ Lyfe, as a platform, is being developed with the primary goal of unifying and gamifying the way that curricular and extra-curricular activity is participated in at the University of Queensland.  This platform needs to appeal to both students who wish to increase activity involvement, and club leaders and teachers who wish to reach out to more people from within the UQ sphere. The application revolves around an experience and levelling system. This system is directly inspired by classic RPG (Role Playing Game) quest logs that allow players to manage what tasks are available for them to complete.

This system is typically broken up into main, secondary and miscellaneous sections and ordered by the amount of experience points gained from the completion. Experience can be earned through various tasks such as attending events, completing tasks, hosting events and having students attend the events you have created. All experience earned contributes to the overall rank associated with the user’s profile. The aim of this rank is to be an overall quantifiable representation of the user’s involvement with UQ. This rank can be compared to other students via a leaderboard system. This app not only aims to motivate students to get involved, but also aims to simply increase awareness of activities on campus and their attendees. Seeing that others are attending an event can spark one’s interest to do the same.

Direct access to the target users will be done through the University of Queensland, St Lucia campus. Random participants will be chosen to ensure that the vast array of contextual backgrounds within the userbase are thoroughly represented. Test sessions will also include contextual questions to ensure that the sample size encompasses this diverse environment. As a group, we also intend on having direct contact with those who currently operate and maintain the societies around UQ. This will initial be done using digital means, with later physical interaction introduced to gather results on prototype. By forming these key relationships, it establishes the future content generators as active participants.

UQ Lyfe differs from current methods with the introduction of:
* Gamification
* Leaderboards
* Social Matchmaking
* Integrated Instant Messaging
* Team based cooperation through a faction and school system
* Map and Timetable integration

### Social & Mobile Theory
* Sense of community with instant messaging, school factions and leaderboards
* Location services suggest nearby events that will start soon for students 
* Create a shared information space to provide a centralised system for UQ events
* Increase awareness within the community by representing the students surroundings
* Introduce a new form of context for UQ students by creating the experience point system 
* Establish a social mobile enviroment to facilitate direct interactions

## Team

### Team Members

Team Member  | Student Number |Role
------------- | ------------- |------------
Rohan Singh   |43945126       |Back end programmer
Mitchell Kiss |43915576       |Front end programmer and designer
Tyler Beutel  |43956476   	  |Front End, UX and designer
Nicole Huang  |44900775		  |Front end programmer, designer and UX
Glenn Duguid  |42650272		  |Front end, Back end programmer and UX

### Roles

* *UX* (User Experience)  
Will be the main connection to the identified users, developing surveys and running the interview sessions. Will consider best practice protocols and analyze the gathered results. Overall goal is to guide the iterative development process. 

* *Designer*  
Will govern the overall feel of the system, creating low fidelity prototypes for user testing. Create initial wireframes and mockups to gain insight from user group and help front end developers govern their design.

* *Front end programmer*  
Design and crate a usable front end system to allow users to seamlessly interact with the product. Will initially be guided by user requirements and low fidelity prototypes.

* *Back end programmer*  
Create the back end component of the application to provide a smooth and usable system. Will work in unity with all other roles to ensure that the created elements consider the context of the intended user.


### Decision Making
Large overarching concept ideas will be discussed and decided on in person when the whole team is together either in workshops or team meetings outside of workshops. More minor details of the project can be discussed in person or via Slack. The team must discuss all decisions that were made during the previous week at each workshop to ensure everyone is caught up and in agreement. Should and disagreements regarding decisions take place, conflict resolution measures will be taken.

### Conflict Resolution
* Any face to face communication that takes place between individual team members should be conducted in a calm and respectful manner by either party. 
* In the case of poor performance or lack of communication from specific team members, a meeting shall be organised within two days (either online or in person) to allow for proposals to be made that will help ensure future performance is up to group standard.
* Further unresolved conflict should be addressed in a following group meeting. All group member positions shall be proposed and considered equally. If a group decision needs to be made, it will be discerned through a vote. Regardless if the group meeting is conducted during or outside of class time, communication must remain civil and respectful.
* If further dispute continues, either in regards to a decision made or the continued behaviour and contributions of specific team members, a tutor shall be immediately notified of the situation and brought into the dialogue. The proceedings will be explained to the tutor and the tutors advice on how proceed will be followed by all team members.

## Communications

### Group Meetings
The group will regularly meet during workshops every week. Workshops are held every Tuesday from 12pm to 2pm. Meetings will be conducted during the workshops and if needed, additional meetings will be arranged. Additional group meetings will be organised if the team deems necessary after workshop each week. Meeting times will be discussed in person and over Facebook if needed until a time that everyone can attend is settled on. Additional meeting times should be agreed upon at least 3 days before the decided time. If team members are unable to attend a meeting, an attempt will be made to reschedule the meeting if time permits all members to be contacted early enough. If the team member who is unable to attend advises the team of their circumstances too late, that team member will be expected to follow up with the group on what was discussed and any decisions that were made.

### Team Communication
Team communication will be conducted through Facebook messaging and the group’s Slack channel (#barnabees) in the deco3500-2017.slack.com group. Facebook will be used for more informal conversation as well as scheduling meetings. This is a good option for us because it is a quick communication tool, and everyone regularily checks Facebook so we will all be up to date. Slack will be used as more formal communication with the team, tutors, lecturer and other students in the course. Overarching discussion of the project will be carried through slack. Team members are expected to check Facebook at least once a day, and the Slack channel at least once a week. Slack is becoming more and more prevalent in the industry. It is easy to use and efficient for communication. It allows us to not only get connect with our own small team but also with others in the class should the need rise. It is a platform we all associate with this class and its content already, so it will be automatic to turn to this forum to discuss our project.

### File Sharing and Storage
A Google Drive folder has been set up to store all the documents, surveys, and other files that the team will be creating. Everyone in the group has access to the folder, so all team members are able to contribute to the documents. Folders will be created if two or more documents are deemed related and should be grouped together. All files and folders will be named appropriately and concisely, clearly denoting their purposes and contents.

### Prototype Management
Github will be used as a collaboration repository to store prototyping code. All team members have access to the repository. Using Github will help the team collaborate code easily, find issues, and solve these issues in an efficient manner.

## Plan

### Stage 1 - Research and Requirements 
* Identify users
* Create user personas
* Interview and survey users
* Identify use context
* Identify technical platform to be used

### Stage 2 - Design 
* Wireframes
* Minimum Viable Product
* Mock-ups
* System architecture
* Low fidelity user testing

### Stage 3 - Development 
* Front end development
* Back end development
* High fidelity user testing

Stage 1 will be completed by 1/9/17. Stage 2 will be completed by 22/9/17. Stage 3 will be completed by 27/10/17. As Stage 2 is 3 weeks long, user testing will be completed 1.5 weeks in on 13/9/17 to allow time for further iterations of the low fidelity prototype. Stage 3 is 4 weeks long and requires more time consuming development, so the first round of user testing will be completed 2 weeks in on 13/10/17. Another round of user testing if necessary will be completed by 20/10/17 to allow a week afterwards to polish and refine everything before submission.

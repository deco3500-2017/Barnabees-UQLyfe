### Concept

The project the team has chosen to develop is driven by a need to increase student involvement in extracurricular activities and also strengthen the sense of community and lifestyle present at the University of Queensland. Additionally, as the campus community can often feel enormous and disconnected, students can lack incentivisation to participate in social events. This product has been labeled UQ Lyfe.

UQ Lyfe, as a platform, is being developed with the primary goal of unifying and gamifying the way that curricular and extra-curricular activity is participated in at the University of Queensland.  This platform needs to appeal to both students who wish to increase activity involvement, and club leaders and teachers who wish to reach out to more people from within the UQ sphere. The application revolves around an experience and levelling system. This system is directly inspired by classic RPG (Role Playing Game) quest logs that allow players to manage what tasks are available for them to complete. This system is typically broken up into main, secondary and miscellaneous sections and ordered by the amount of experience points gained from the completion. from Experience can be earned through various tasks such as attending events, completing tasks, hosting events and having students attend the events you have created. All experience earned contributes to the overall rank associated with the user’s profile. This aim of the rank is to be an overall quantifiable representation of the user’s involvement with UQ. This rank can be compared to other students via a leaderboard system. This app not only aims to motivate students to get involved, but also aims to simply increase awareness of activities on campus and their attendees. Seeing that others are attending an event can spark one’s interest to do the same.
Our application differs from current UQ methods with the introduction of gamification, leaderboards, social matchmaking, integrated instant messaging, team based cooperation through a faction/school system and map integration, all within one platform.
